# Project-Based-Internship-ID-X-Partners-Rakamin-

# Program Overview
This Project-Based Internship program is a collaboration with ID/X Partners. The goal is to develop a credit risk prediction model using machine learning, which helps a multifinance company optimize credit decision-making and reduce potential financial losses.

# Objective
The project focuses on building a model to predict credit risk based on loan application data, classifying applicants into Good or Bad credit risk categories.

# Challenges
- Data Understanding: Analyze and understand the provided loan dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and identify key patterns and correlations in the data.
- Data Preparation: Preprocess the data (handling missing values, scaling, encoding).
- Modeling: Train a Logistic Regression model and another algorithm (e.g., Random Forest).
- Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, recall, and ROC-AUC.

# Datasets
The dataset used for this project includes various loan-related attributes such as:
- Loan Status (Approved/Rejected)
- Applicant Information
- Financial History and many more

# Tech Stack
- Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
